          <p>
            The Prophet Muhammad said, “Charity is a proof”. It is a proof of your belief. How you
            give to others is the very proof of your creed, your own faith. Feeding those that are
            hungry, according to the Quran (and previous scriptures), has always been important to
            God, and therefore to those who believe in Him. People and communities of faith have a
            responsibility to meet the needs of the poor and hunger. Feed the needy!In this modern
            age of increasing obesity and satiety, it is inexcusable that we have people dying of
            starvation. To quote, “There is more fruit in a rich mans shampoo, than a poor mans
            plate. Feed the needy! <br />
            Feeding the Hungry is one amongst several pillars of charity that the East Plano Islamic
            Center (IDL) erected under its IDL CARES program and is dedicated to the mission of
            ending hunger by partnering up with local food banks and pantries to provide access to
            daily meals for hungry children, seniors, families of the DFW community.Just as the
            Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) fed on average 70 people each day, and Prophet Jesus repeatedly
            shared meals with “tax collectors and sinners”, people that the rest of society largely
            ignored or despised, so too we shall follow in their blessed footsteps.

              Texas ranks #2 in nationally in food-insecure population. More than 4.65 million
              Texans last year—including nearly 1.9 million children—had limited or uncertain access
              to enough food for a healthy lifestyle, a study by Feeding America revealed.

              One in every six individuals of all ages (517,800) faces food insecurity.

              One in every four kids in North Texas is food insecure. In Dallas County alone, there
              are approximately 179, 020 children who are food insecure, meaning they have a lack of
              access at times to enough food for an active, healthy life.

            <li class="list-disc">
              Food insecure children are sick more often and are more likely to suffer developmental

              Unemployment is the primary driver of food insecurity….without income that comes from
              a job, people often lack the resources to purchase an adequate amount of food.

          <p>
            The coming together of various organizations in local hunger relief efforts is key to
            fighting the good fight in ending food insecurity and hunger. IDL aims to be in the
            middle of it all. Our Muslim community, as with all other faith-based communities, can
            and will make a difference TOGETHER. Every congregation must take action and leverage
            the tried and tested solutions to the problem of hunger. These solutions exist in the
            community, require limited financial support, and they need the support of local
            congregations that can make an impact.

          <p>
            The North Texas Food Bank (NTFB) is a top-ranked nonprofit relief organization,
            providing access to more than 190,000 meals each day for hungry children, seniors and
            families through a network of more than 1,000 programs and 200 Partner Agencies in our
            13-county service area. In fiscal year 2016, NTFB provided access to some 70 million
            meals but the need for hunger relief in North Texas today is much larger. To combat
            increasing food insecurity in North Texas, the Food Bank recently launched a 10-year
            plan to provide access to 92 million nutritious meals annually by 2025. NTFB is a member
            of Feeding America, a national hunger relief organization.
