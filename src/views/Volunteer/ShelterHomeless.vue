            <p>
              Homelessness or the risk of homelessness affects millions of people every year. Job
              loss, low wages, disability, substance abuse, family conflict, domestic violence and
              other factors contribute to the problem. While most people experiencing or facing
              homelessness are adults, particularly veterans, many of the homeless are families with
              children. Even though we can’t reach to all or part, the idea is to help little of
              those in need.

            <p>
              Homelessness is one of our nation’s most misunderstood and vexing social problems.
              Homelessness does not discriminate. Families with children, single adults, teenagers
              and older individuals of all races struggle with the devastating effects of
              homelessness. <br />
              Every year 600,000 families with 1.35 million children experience homelessness in the
              United States, making up about 50 percent of the homeless population over the course
              of the year.
            </p>
          </div>

              Cause of this phenomena or why this is happening more and more every year?
            </h1>
            <p>
              The primary cause of homelessness is a lack of affordable housing, domestic violence
              etc . Over five million low-income households have serious housing problems due to
              high housing costs, substandard housing conditions or both. While the problem of
              homelessness seems daunting, we can end homelessness in our nation.<br />
              There are hundreds of families living in dangerously overcrowded housing. They’re
              moving from place to place, night after night, in a constant state of fear and mere
              survival.

              How can we make a difference and how can we measure the change?
            </h1>
            <p>
              While permanent housing, often coupled with supportive services, is the best way to
              end homelessness, many individuals and families need short-term stabilization before
              they can find housing that will meet their long term needs. Through IDL volunteering
              services we can provide emergency assistance to homeless persons in the form of
              homeless shelters. We can operate drop-in centers — places where homeless youth or
              adults can get off the streets and find a temporary safe haven. And often, when
              homeless persons begin to trust our volunteering work, they agree to leave the streets
              and enter transitional or permanent housing.<br />
              We can work with the group they already working and familiar with this type of
              volunteering work and handling it’s legality etc.,
              <br />
              For a significant number of homeless Americans with mental or physical impairments,
              often coupled with drug and/or alcohol use issues, long-term homelessness can only be
              ended by providing permanent housing coupled with intensive supportive services.We can
              also work on a transitional housing program to operate with one goal in mind — to help
              individuals and families obtain permanent housing as quickly as possible. Identify the
              individuals, identify their family members, communicate with the family, understand
              the situation and work towards solving issues.
